My role involved developing features across the full stack, using Angular and TypeScript on the frontend and Kotlin with Google Cloud Spanner on the backend. I worked on making the tool more efficient by optimizing the data-fetching logic, which eliminated redundant backend API calls, improving system performance and resolving timeout issues. I also made database queries faster by creating a materialized view with proper indexing, which enhanced the overall performance.",
